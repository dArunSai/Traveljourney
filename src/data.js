      "Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan, standing at 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft). It is an active stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707–08. Mount Fuji lies about 100 kilometers (60 mi) south-west of Tokyo and can be seen from there on a clear day. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is snow-capped several months a year, is a well-known symbol of Japan and it is frequently depicted in art and photographs, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers. An estimated 200,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2019, and the figure includes climbers who repeated the feat. The most-popular period for people to climb Mount Fuji is from July to August, with the official climbing season lasting only two months. The mountain is divided into 10 stations, with the fifth station being the most popular. The fifth station is accessible by car and bus, and it is the starting point for many climbers. The climb to the summit takes between five and 10 hours, and the descent can take up to half that time. The mountain is considered so sacred that some climbers make the pilgrimage to the summit in silence.",

      "The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first Emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).",

Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96). The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).",
